# Mouse Study Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the Mouse Study Data Analysis Project repository. This project is a comprehensive analysis of a dataset from a study on the effects of various drug regimens on tumor growth in mice. It demonstrates my skills in data handling, statistical analysis, and visualization in Python.

## Project Overview
The project involves several key stages:
1. **Data Preparation**: Merging datasets, identifying and removing duplicates, creating a clean DataFrame.
2. **Summary Statistics**: Computing mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volumes.
3. **Visualizations**: Creating bar charts and pie charts with Pandas and Matplotlib.
4. **Advanced Analysis**: Calculating quartiles, identifying outliers, and generating box plots.
5. **Correlation and Regression Analysis**: Analyzing the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using git:

```bash
